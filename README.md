# Codveda Machine Learning Internship

This repository documents my progress and implementation of tasks assigned during the Codveda Machine Learning Internship.

The internship is structured into multiple levels, focusing on building strong machine learning foundations and progressing toward advanced modeling techniques.

---

## 🟢 Level 1 

Level 1 focuses on:

- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Classification modeling
- Model evaluation

### Tasks Completed

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values
- Encoded categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding
- Standardized numerical features
- Performed train-test split

### 2️⃣ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
- Trained KNN model
- Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall
- Visualized Confusion Matrix
- Compared multiple values of K
- Saved trained model using `joblib`

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- joblib
